# R-radar-utils-aca0412

This repository is a partial translation of the IDL scripts used in the Meteorology by Radar (ACA0412) course in 2022 at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of São Paulo (IAG/USP) taught by professor Carlos Morales. 

## Introduction

There is not a known R package with all tools needed to manipulate weather radar data, from common mathematical and geographical operations to make plots, as opposed to Python language (e.g.: [Py-ART](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/)). This repository aims to translate some IDL scripts so that R language can be used in the Meteorology by Radar (ACA0412) course at University of São Paulo, and maybe serve as a base to make a complete weather radar R package in the future.
